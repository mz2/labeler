	<h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
	<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. These machines can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and understanding natural language.</p>
	<p>AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. However, there are also concerns about the impact of AI on jobs and society, as well as the ethical implications of creating machines that can think and learn like humans.</p>
