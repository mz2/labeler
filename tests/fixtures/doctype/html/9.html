	<p>Cats are popular pets around the world. They are known for their independence and their ability to clean themselves. Some people think that cats are aloof and not affectionate, but this is not true. Many cats enjoy being petted and will even curl up on their owners' laps. There are many different breeds of cats, each with its own unique characteristics. Some cats are long-haired, while others are short-haired. Some are big, while others are small. No matter what kind of cat you have, it's important to give it love and attention.</p>
