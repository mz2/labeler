	<h1>My Trip to Thailand</h1>
	<p>Last summer, I went on a trip to Thailand and it was absolutely amazing. From the bustling streets of Bangkok to the beautiful beaches of Phuket, Thailand has so much to offer. I tried lots of delicious Thai food, like pad thai and green curry, and visited temples and markets. One of the highlights of my trip was riding an elephant through the jungle. It was an unforgettable experience that I'll never forget.</p>
